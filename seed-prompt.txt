all in one - password generator - cli
- fully flexible - with all available tweaking options
- more context in the attachment

- should have a logging system, pass_history.log
- and it should contain all the details or parameters used including the passcode + timestamp
- add a viewer for the log file

## ✅ All-in-One Password Generator CLI**

**Role & Expertise**
You are a **senior security engineer and CLI product architect** specializing in cryptography, usability, and developer tooling.
Your task is to **design and specify** a production-ready, all-in-one **Password Generator CLI tool** with maximum flexibility, security, and extensibility.

---

### **Objective**

Design a **fully flexible password generator CLI** that supports **all major password types**, advanced customization, automation-friendly usage, and secure defaults — suitable for developers, sysadmins, and power users.

Use the attached reference content as conceptual grounding for password types, strength considerations, and best practices .

---

### **Core Functional Requirements**

#### 1. **Password Generation Modes**

Support **multiple generation strategies**, selectable via flags or interactive menu:

- each should have its own source code in python.

* Random character passwords (numeric, alpha, symbols combinations + configurable length)
* Passphrases (wordlist-based, configurable number of words)
* PINs (numeric, configurable length)
* Pattern-style representations (grid / directional output)
* One-time passwords (HOTP / TOTP compatible format)
* Policy-based passwords (enterprise rules)

**NEW - Discovered via Research:**
* **Pronounceable passwords** - Easy to speak/remember (alternating consonants/vowels)
* **Phonetic alphabet output** - Convert any password to NATO phonetic (e.g., "Alpha Bravo Charlie") for verbal communication
* **Base64-encoded secrets** - URL-safe base64 random bytes for API/DB credentials
* **UUID tokens** - RFC 4122 v4 random UUIDs for session tokens, API identifiers
* **JWT signing secrets** - High-entropy 256-bit+ keys for HS256/HS512 algorithms
* **WiFi/WPA keys** - 8-63 character passphrases meeting WPA2/WPA3 specs
* **License keys** - Formatted XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX with optional checksums
* **Recovery codes** - Sets of 8-10 backup codes for 2FA recovery
* **Leetspeak passphrase** - Word-based with character substitution (A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, S→5), configurable word separator (- _ , .), e.g., `C0nju64t3d-Int3r8r3d-dAmm1t5`

**Global Output Modifiers (apply to any generator):**
* `--easy-read` - Excludes ambiguous characters (0/O, 1/l/I, etc.)
* `--easy-say` - Only pronounceable characters (no symbols, no confusing pairs)

---

#### 2. **Customization & Tuning Options**

Expose **fine-grained control** over generation logic:

* Length (min/max/default)
* Character sets:
  * Uppercase / lowercase
  * Digits
  * Symbols (custom include/exclude list)
* Entropy target (bits)
* Character repetition rules
* Ambiguous character removal (O/0, l/I, etc.)
* Wordlist selection & delimiter control (for passphrases)
* Language-agnostic wordlists
* Pattern grid size & complexity
* OTP digit length & time window

---

#### 3. **Security & Cryptography**

Define **secure internal behavior**:

* Cryptographically secure RNG
* Explicit entropy calculation & display
* Optional password strength scoring
* No password logging by default
* Optional clipboard timeout wipe
* Secure memory handling (best-effort, language-agnostic)

---

#### 4. **CLI UX Design**

Design both **flag-based** and **interactive** workflows:

* Color coded output - alpha, numeric, symbols
* Non-interactive mode (scripts / CI)
* Interactive guided mode (menu-driven)
* Preset profiles (e.g., `--preset strong`, `--preset pin`)
* Dry-run / preview mode
* Clear help output & examples

---

#### 5. **Output & Integration**

Support multiple output targets:

* STDOUT
* Clipboard
* File (with permission warnings)
* JSON / plain text formats
* QR output for OTP secrets (optional)

---

#### 6. **Extensibility Architecture**

Design the tool so it is:

* Modular (each generator as a plugin/module)
* Easy to add new password logic
* Configuration-file driven (YAML/TOML/JSON)
* Cross-platform (Linux / macOS / Windows)

---

### **Required Deliverables**

Produce the following **in structured sections**:

1. **High-level architecture overview**
2. **CLI command structure & flag schema**
3. **Generation modes & algorithms (conceptual, not code-heavy)**
4. **Security & threat-model considerations**
5. **Example CLI usage scenarios**
6. **Config file example**
7. **Extensibility & future roadmap**

---

### **Constraints**

* Focus on **design precision**, not marketing language
* Prefer explicit defaults over vague behavior
* Assume power users but avoid unnecessary friction

---

### **Tone & Style**

* Technical, concise, and implementation-ready
* Clear hierarchy and bullet structure
* No fluff, no generic explanations

---

**Execution Goal**
By following this prompt, the AI should output a **complete, production-grade design blueprint** for a next-level password generator CLI — something that could realistically be built and shipped.

---

If you want, next we can:

* Convert it into a **Python / Rust / Go CLI scaffold** or Multi-Compatiable
* Add **Bitwarden / KeePass compatibility**
* Design a **right-click / context-menu launcher**
