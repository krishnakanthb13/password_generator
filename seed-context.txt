Passwords can be of several types, each balancing security and convenience differently.

## Core password types

- **Alphanumeric passwords**: Use letters and digits (e.g., A1b2C3); security depends mainly on length and randomness.
- **Passphrases**: Long sequences of words or sentences (e.g., “CorrectHorseBatteryStaple”) that are more secure yet easier to remember than short complex strings.
- **PINs**: Short numeric codes (often 4–6 digits) widely used in banking and device unlock, convenient but weaker if too simple.
- **Biometric passwords**: Use unique physical or behavioral traits (fingerprint, face, iris) to authenticate, offering high security and convenience but needing special hardware.
- **Pattern-based passwords**: Graphical patterns (like Android lock-screen) that many users find easier to remember and draw on touch devices.
- **One-time passwords (OTP)**: Single-use codes sent via SMS, email, app, or token, mainly used in 2FA/MFA to add an extra security layer for logins and transactions.

## Strong password tips

- Use at least 12 characters, mixing upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid obvious data (name, DOB, “123456”, “qwerty”) and dictionary words; prefer unique, random passwords or passphrases per account.
- Enable multi-factor authentication, use a password manager, and update important passwords regularly to reduce breach impact.

## PassForge Implemented Standards (v1.0.0 Refinements)

- **Smart Leetspeak**: Uses a 50% probability for character substitution (e.g., 'A' might become '4' or stay 'A') to ensure the secret is both secure and human-readable.
- **AXB License Keys**: Supports any segment count (A) and segment length (B), moving beyond the legacy 4x4 fixed format.
- **Visual Grid Patterns**: Security is calculated based on path permutations within the grid size (3x3 to 5x5).
- **NATO Phonetic Conversion**: Supports translating any alphanumeric string into the NATO standard (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie) for secure verbal communication.
- **Zero-Indentation UI**: All terminal output is strictly aligned to Column 0 for a professional, technical aesthetic.
- **Unified Auto-Logging**: Interactive menus and launchers automatically record generations to history by default to prevent data loss.

Different types of passwords include alphanumeric (letters, numbers, symbols), passphrases (long,, memorable, phrase-based), PINs (numeric only), biometrics (fingerprint/face), and one-time passwords (OTP). Stronger security is achieved using 16+ characters with varied symbols. Modern security often uses multifactor authentication (MFA) or passkeys rather than just one password. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Key Types of Passwords and Authentication 

• Alphanumeric: Combines uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters (e.g., ). 
• Passphrases: Long strings of words that are easy to remember but hard to crack (e.g., ). 
• PIN (Personal Identification Number): Numeric-only codes, usually 4-6 digits, used for devices or banking. 
• Biometric Passwords: Unique biological traits such as fingerprints, voice patterns, or facial recognition. 
• Pattern-Based Passwords: A visual, geometric pattern drawn on a grid, commonly used on mobile devices. 
• One-Time Password (OTP): A temporary code sent via SMS or generated by an app, valid for only one session. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]  

Best Practices for Secure Passwords 

• Length is Strength: Passwords should be at least 16 characters long. 
• Uniqueness: Use a different password for every account. 
• Avoid Personal Info: Do not use birthdays, names, or common dictionary words. 
• Use a Password Manager: Store complex, unique passwords for all accounts in a secure vault. [4, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

Comparing Strength 

• Weak: 8-digit numeric PIN ($10^8$ combinations). 
• Strong: 8-character mix of letters and numbers ($36^8$ combinations). 
• Stronger: 8-character mix of letters, numbers, and symbols ($72^8$ combinations). [6, 12]

Types of Password

Passwords come in various forms, including text passwords, PINs, biometric passwords, passphrases, and pattern passwords. Each type offers different levels of security and convenience, catering to diverse authentication needs and preferences.

• Text Passwords: These are words or phrases you type in, like "Sunshine123."
• PINs (Personal Identification Numbers): These are short numbers, like "1234…." you use to unlock things.
• Biometric Passwords: Here we use unique biological traits (body impressions) like finger prints, iris etc., to verify an individual's identity, to authenticate and unlock devices.
• Passphrases: These are longer, easy-to-remember sentences, like "I Love My Parents!"
• Pattern Passwords: Here we draw a shape or pattern, like connecting dots, to unlock something and gain access.
